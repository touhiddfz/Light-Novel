        <h1>Contract Formation on the Head of the Great Ape King</h1>
        <p>
            "Buzz!" Suddenly, a faint golden light lit up in the conference room. Since the five beasts provided by Zhou Wenlong were artificially cultivated descendants of monster beasts, although they still had some ferocious aura, they did not resist the contract.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon, the golden contract formation gradually disappeared above the head of the Great Ape King. At the same time, Ye Feng suddenly felt the thoughts and emotions of the Great Ape King in front of him. Not only that, the way the Great Ape King looked at Ye Feng was no longer the same as before.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the Great Ape King looked at Ye Feng with a strange and cold look before, then the look he looked at him now was full of emotion. It can be said that at this moment, the two became close partners.
